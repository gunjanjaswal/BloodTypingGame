# Blood Typing Game

An educational web-based game about blood types, blood typing, and blood transfusions, inspired by the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Karl Landsteiner for the discovery of human blood groups.

## About the Game

The Blood Typing Game teaches players about:
- Different blood groups in the ABO and Rh blood group systems
- Antibodies and antigens in different blood types
- Blood typing techniques
- Blood transfusion compatibility
- Consequences of incorrect blood transfusions

## How to Play

1. Start the game from the main menu
2. For each patient:
   - Perform blood tests using the Anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-Rh serums
   - Determine the patient's blood type based on the test results
   - Select a compatible blood bag for transfusion
   - Perform the transfusion and see the results
3. Try to save all five patients to get a perfect score

## Blood Type Compatibility

Understanding blood type compatibility is crucial for safe transfusions:

- Type A can receive from: A and O
- Type B can receive from: B and O
- Type AB can receive from: A, B, AB, and O (universal recipient)
- Type O can receive from: O only
- Rh+ can receive from: Rh+ and Rh-
- Rh- can receive from: Rh- only

Type O Rh- is considered the universal donor.

## Educational Value

This game helps players understand:
- The importance of Karl Landsteiner's discovery of blood groups
