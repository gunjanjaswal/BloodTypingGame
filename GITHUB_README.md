*An interactive educational web game about blood types, transfusions, and medical science*

</div>

## 📋 Overview

An interactive educational web game that teaches users about blood types, blood typing procedures, and safe blood transfusions. This project is inspired by the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Karl Landsteiner for the discovery of human blood groups.

## 🎮 Play the Game

The Blood Typing Game challenges players to:
1. Determine patients' blood types through simulated blood tests
2. Select compatible blood bags for transfusion
3. Save lives by performing correct transfusions
4. Learn about blood type compatibility and the science behind it

## 🧪 Educational Content

The game covers:

- **ABO and Rh Blood Group Systems**
  - Type A: Has A antigens and B antibodies
  - Type B: Has B antigens and A antibodies
  - Type AB: Has both A and B antigens, no A or B antibodies
  - Type O: No A or B antigens, has both A and B antibodies
  - Rh+ and Rh- factors

- **Blood Transfusion Compatibility**
  - Universal donor (O-)
  - Universal recipient (AB+)
  - Compatibility rules between different blood types
  - Consequences of incompatible transfusions

- **Nobel Prize Connection**
  - Karl Landsteiner's discovery of human blood groups in 1901
  - The 1930 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
  - Impact on modern medicine and transfusion safety

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 💻 Prerequisites
- ![Chrome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome-4285F4?style=flat-square&logo=googlechrome&logoColor=white) ![Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-FF7139?style=flat-square&logo=firefoxbrowser&logoColor=white) ![Safari](https://img.shields.io/badge/Safari-000000?style=flat-square&logo=safari&logoColor=white) ![Edge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Edge-0078D7?style=flat-square&logo=microsoftedge&logoColor=white) A modern web browser
- ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=flat-square&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white) (optional, for running the local development server)

### 📍 Installation

1. 💼 Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gunjanjaswal/BloodTypingGame.git
```

2. 👁️ Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd BloodTypingGame
```

3. 📈 To run with Node.js server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. 🌟 Alternatively, simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

> 💡 **Tip:** For the best experience, use a modern browser with JavaScript enabled.

## 🎯 How to Play

1. 🔹 **Start the Game**: Click the "Start Game" button on the main menu
2. 🔹 **For Each Patient**:
   - 🧪 **Test the Blood**: Use Anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-Rh serums to test the patient's blood
   - 🔎 **Observe Reactions**: Watch for agglutination (clumping) which indicates presence of antigens
   - 📝 **Determine Blood Type**: Based on test results, select the correct blood type
   - 🩸 **Select Compatible Blood**: Choose a blood bag that's compatible with the patient
   - 💉 **Perform Transfusion**: Click the button to perform the transfusion
3. 🔹 **Score**: Try to save all five patients to achieve a perfect score

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Incorrect blood type matching can cause transfusion reactions!

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Players will gain valuable knowledge about:

- 🧪 **Blood Typing Techniques**: Learn how medical professionals determine blood types
- 🩸 **Transfusion Compatibility**: Understand which blood types can safely be given to which recipients
- 🔍 **Antigen-Antibody Reactions**: Visualize how blood type incompatibilities cause reactions
- 📜 **Medical History**: Discover the Nobel Prize-winning work of Karl Landsteiner
- 🎓 **Clinical Applications**: See how blood typing knowledge saves lives in medical settings

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Exciting features planned for future releases:
